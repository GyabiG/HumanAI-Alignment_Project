# HumanAI-Alignment_Project
Term project for Human AI alignment class at the University of Utah
I worked on creating a reinforcement learning for the mountain car environment based on maximum entropy IRL that can be fine-tuned with reward adjustment given using the space bar based on the TAMER and COACH algorithms.
